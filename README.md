✨ I'm Maria, a self-taught frontend developer and UX/UI designer based in Nara. I used to work in the tourism industry, but now I'm looking for new opportunities in the IT industry.
When I’m not coding, I will probably be taking photos or reading some book. 


-　🔭 I’m currently working on two personal projects. They are not that fancy, but I am using them for practice ✌🏻
  --A <a href="https://github.com/mcosme000/Recipe-App" target="_blank">Recipe App</a> that uses an API and shows yummy foods
  -- A fun <a href="https://github.com/mcosme000/chat-app" target="_blank">Chatt App</a> where the users are dogs. I made this for JavaScript practice and to be creative
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RUBY and Ruby on Rails
